Firstly I must thank my supervisor Gert van der Heijden for his insight, patience and enthusiasm. It has been a pleasure and an honour to work alongside. %

This thesis represents the cumulation of many years of (hard) study. I hope to thank everyone who has contributed in any way and I apologise in advance to those I may have missed out. I would like to thank the contribution of my friends and colleagues at University College London - Jason, Tristan, Ali, Joe, Joao, Laurent, Ricky and Simon for fixing my computer and talking about football. The good friends I made while at the University of Bath - David, Sioned, Spyros, Caroline, Vicky, Jackie and Nefeli. My friends from undergraduate days at Imperial College London - Mike, Tim, Dom and Alan. Friends from school and those met randomly along the way - Phil, James, Paul, Lewis, Kate, Ryan, Doug, Sean, Emma and Kirsty for sharing jokes and probably too many drinks. Time was I wasn't working was as important to work as the time spent working. %

Lastly, I would like to thank all my family Teta and Granddad, Colin and Gay, Stephen and Shani, Trevor, Grandma (without her kindness and generosity this thesis would have never been finished) and Granddad and of course Mum, Dad, Paul, Graeme and Debra for all their support, interest and love. This is both for and because of them. %
